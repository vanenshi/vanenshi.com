Ever felt like you're drowning in a sea of `index.ts` files? Trust me, I've been there. Working on a massive React project, I found myself constantly lost in a maze of identical-looking files. But then I stumbled upon a game-changer: VS Code's custom labels feature. Let me tell you how it transformed my coding life.

## The Problem with `index.ts` Overload



Picture this: You're deep in the zone, juggling multiple components, when suddenly you need to find that one specific `index.ts` file. You open the search bar, and bam! A flood of indistinguishable results. Frustrating, right? That's exactly where I was until I discovered the magic of custom labels.

## Enter Custom Labels

So, what's the deal with these custom labels? In a nutshell, they're VS Code's way of letting you personalize how file names appear in your editor tabs and search bar. For us React devs drowning in `index.ts` files, it's like throwing us a lifeline.

## Setting Up Custom Labels Step by Step

### 1. Enable Custom Labels

First, you'll need to enable custom labels in your VS Code settings. Just add this line to your settings.json:

```json
"workbench.editor.customLabels.enabled": true
```

### 2. Define Patterns for `index.ts` Files

Now, here's where the real magic happens. Add this bit to tell VS Code to replace those generic `index.ts` names with their parent directory names:

```json
"workbench.editor.customLabels.patterns": {
  "**/index.{ts,js,tsx,jsx}": "${dirname}"
}
```

### 3. Customize for Specific Directories

If you're like me and have a specific folder where all your components live, you can target just that directory:

```json
"workbench.editor.customLabels.patterns": {
  "components/*/index.{ts,js,tsx,jsx}": "${dirname}"
}
```

## The Benefits of Custom Labels

1. **Increased Readability**: Instead of a sea of `index.tsx` tabs, you'll see "Button", "Header", and so on. It's like your editor suddenly learned to speak your language!

2. **Efficient Searching**: Searching for specific components became a breeze.

3. **Reduced Mental Load**: No more second-guessing which `index.ts` I was looking at.

So, fellow coders, if you're tired of playing "Where's Waldo?" with your `index.ts` files, give custom labels a shot. It's a small change that packs a big punch in your daily coding life. Trust me, your future self will thank you!
