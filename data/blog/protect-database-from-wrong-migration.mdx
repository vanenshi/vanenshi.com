As a .NET developer, I had a close call when I applied a migration to my production database without changing the database connection string. I was mortified when I realized my mistake, but I quickly got to work finding a solution to prevent it from happening again.

That's when I came up with the idea to add a console message that displays the migration details before applying it. This simple addition gives me the chance to review the migration details and ensure that I am working with the correct database before making any changes.

With this new safeguard in place, I can breathe easy knowing that my production database is safe from accidental alterations. It just goes to show that sometimes the simplest solutions can be the most effective.

```csharp
public class ApplicationDbContextFactory : IDesignTimeDbContextFactory<ApplicationDbContext>
{
    public ApplicationDbContext CreateDbContext(string[] args)
    {
        // ... Some code to generate dbContextBuilder
        var context = new ApplicationDbContext(dbContextBuilder.Options);

        // This is where magic happens
        var pendingMigrations = context.Database.GetPendingMigrations();
        Console.WriteLine("*********************************************\n");

        Console.WriteLine("This command is going to apply migrations with following details");

        Console.Write("ConnectionString: ");
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
        Console.WriteLine(connectionString);
        Console.ResetColor();

        Console.Write("Migrations:\n\t");
        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Yellow;
        Console.WriteLine(string.Join("\n\t", value: pendingMigrations.ToArray()));
        Console.ResetColor();
        Console.WriteLine();
        Console.WriteLine("*********************************************");

        Console.WriteLine("Do You confirm? (Y/N)");
        var userInput = (Console.ReadLine());

        if (userInput is "Y" or "y")
            return context;

        Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Red;
        Console.WriteLine("Aborted!");
        Environment.Exit(1);
        return null;
    }
}
```
